RayTrAgno
=========

RayTrAgno is the name given to an attempt, which may become
one day a prototype, or maybe a real projet, to create a raytracer in rust
wasm using webgpu.

RayTrAgno is also for me an adventure to learn more about multiple
subjects that I know nothing about. A playful learning journey that
started at a time in my life when I need to take my mind off my routine
and take a breather on what is going on around me.
